Givewell has recommended AMF as a top charity several times. In 2013, Givewell estimated that it costs AMF about $6.13 to distribute one LLIN and $3,400 to save the life of one child.

__**[Animal Charity Evaluators](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/)**__ investigates the most effective ways of reducing non-human animal suffering. Since there are many non-human animals living in extremely painful conditions on factory farms, animal suffering could be a very highly effective altruistic cause.

__**[CEA](http://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/)**__: The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) is a coalition of projects related to EA. Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours are both part of CEA.  They also run the Global Priorities Project and other special projects and raise public awareness of EA.

__**[Center for Applied Rationality](http://rationality.org/)**__ runs 4 day workshops on, no surprises here, rationality. They often give significant discounts to effective altruists, and a lot of people report benefiting from doing one.

__**[Charity Science](http://www.charityscience.com/)**__ wants to revolutionize doing good the same way that science revolutionized medicine. They consider which activities actually help people and which don’t, looking at the science. CS advocate for the most evidence-based and cost effective interventions.

In particular, GiveWell seesk out charities who provide strong evidence of impact-per-dollar and room for more funding, and who can demonstrate trustworthiness and transparency. GiveWell recommends just a few charities at a time, and many of these recommendations inform the donations of many effective altruists.

__**[GWWC](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us)**__: Giving What We Can (GWWC) is an international society dedicated to eradicating extreme poverty. GWWC recommends cost-effective charities and encourages individuals to sign its pledge, which represents a commitment to donate a fraction of one’s incoome to effective anti-poverty charities, GWWC also has local chapters that meet in cities in the UK, USA, and elsewhere.

__**[MIRI](http://intelligence.org/research/)**__: The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI) is an non-profit whose mission is to “ensure that the creation of smarter-than-human intelligence has a positive impact.” MIRI’s main activity is to conduct research on a few topics: How can a machine reason coherently about its own behavior? What is a better formalization for decision-making under uncertainty? How can we specify an AI’s goals to ensure that it matches our intentions, even as the AI modifies itself? What AI-related interventions are the most beneficial?

__**[Raising for Effective Giving](http://reg-charity.org/)**__, a project from EAF, encourages touring poker players to donate 2% of their winnings (which sometimes totals tens of millions).

GiveWell has recommended SCI as a top charity, and in 2013, estimated that it costs $0.80 to deworm one child, with SCI paying about 70% of these costs (see “leveraging donations”).

__**[TLYCS](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/aboutus.aspx)**__: The Life You Can Save (TLYCS) is a non-profit founded by philosopher Peter Singer. It promotes effecitve altruism – with a focus on reducing poverty and economic inequality – through public outreach. TLYCS seeks to create local groups of informed givers and a global online community, and encourages individuals to sign its charitable-donation pledge.

Additionally, many individual writers and other sites have interesting material on effective altruism, some of which can be found **[here](https://eahub.org/links#blogs)**.
